    "## Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list is a linear data structure made up of a collection of elements that are linked with each other, and each elements points to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements are better known as **nodes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node in a linked list contains two items:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data/value\n",
    "- Reference to the next element/pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "The first node in a linked list is called a **Head**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last node in a linked list points to null/empty value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists are a **dynamic** data structure since it does not have a given size and amount of memory pre-defined. They can grow easily in size and memory.\n",
    "![](https://www.alphacodingskills.com/imgfiles/linked-list.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Singly linked list** - one described above; with the first element(head) pointing to the next element and the last element pointing to null.\n",
    "- **Doubly linked list** - each node has two references; one to the next element and another to the previous element.\n",
    "- **Circular linked list** - where the last node points back to the first node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked lists are great for **adding** and **removing** elements. However, they are slow to search and access elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison to arrays, linked lists are great for inserting and deleting elements while arrays are great for random access and traversing through the elements."

    "\n",
    "### Basic Terminologies of Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Front:** Position of the entry in a queue ready to be served, that is, the first entry that will be removed from the queue, is called the **front** of the queue. It is also referred as the **head** of the queue.\n",
    "- **Rear:** Position of the last entry in the queue, that is, the one most recently added, is called the **rear** of the queue. It is also referred as the **tail** of the queue.\n",
    "- **Size:** Size refers to the **current** number of elements in the queue.\n",
    "- **Capacity:** Capacity refers to the **maximum** number of elements the queue can hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Queues\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue data structure can be classified into 4 types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Queue:** Simple Queue simply follows **FIFO** Structure. We can only insert the element at the back and remove the element from the front of the queue. A simple queue is efficiently implemented either using a linked list or a circular array.\n",
    "2. **Double-Ended Queue (Deque):** In a **double-ended queue** the insertion and deletion operations, both can be performed from both ends. They are of two types:\n",
    "    - **Input Restricted Queue:** This is a simple queue. In this type of queue, the input can be taken from only one end but deletion can be done from any of the ends.\n",
    "    - **Output Restricted Queue:** This is also a simple queue. In this type of queue, the input can be taken from both ends but deletion can be done from only one end.\n",
    "3. **Priority Queue:** A **priority queue** is a special queue where the elements are accessed based on the priority assigned to them. They are of two types:\n",
    "- **Ascending Priority Queue:** In Ascending Priority Queue, the elements are arranged in increasing order of their priority values. Element with smallest priority value is popped first.\n",
    "- **Descending Priority Queue:** In Descending Priority Queue, the elements are arranged in decreasing order of their priority values. Element with largest priority is popped first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queue Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enqueue**: Adds an element to the end (rear) of the queue. If the queue is full, an overflow error occurs.\n",
    "2. **Dequeue**: Removes the element from the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, an underflow error occurs.\n",
    "3. **Peek/Front**: Returns the element at the front without removing it.\n",
    "4. **Size**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.\n",
    "5. **isEmpty**: Returns `true` if the queue is empty, otherwise `false`.\n",
    "6. **isFull**: Returns `true` if the queue is full, otherwise `false`."
