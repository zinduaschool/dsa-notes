    "## Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tree data structure** is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in the form of parent child relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Terminologies In Tree Data Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parent Node:** The node which is an immediate predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node.\n",
    "- **Child Node:** The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node. \n",
    "- **Root Node:** The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node.A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree.\n",
    "- **Leaf Node:** The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes. \n",
    "- **Sibling:** Children of the same parent node are called siblings.\n",
    "- **Level of a node:** The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node has level **0**.\n",
    "- **Subtree**: Any node of the tree along with its descendant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Tree data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree data structure can be classified into three types based upon the number of children each node of the tree can have. The types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Tree:** In a binary tree, each node can have a maximum of two children linked to it.\n",
    "- **Ternary Tree:** A Ternary Tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most three child nodes, usually distinguished as “left”, “mid” and “right”.\n",
    "- **N-ary Tree or Generic Tree:** Generic trees are a collection of nodes where each node is a data structure that consists of records and a list of references to its children(duplicate references are not allowed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Tree Data Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of edges:** An edge can be defined as the connection between two nodes. If a tree has N nodes then it will have (N-1) edges. There is only one path from each node to any other node of the tree.\n",
    "- **Depth of a node:** The depth of a node is defined as the length of the path from the root to that node. Each edge adds 1 unit of length to the path. So, it can also be defined as the number of edges in the path from the root of the tree to the node.\n",
    "- **Height of a node:** The height of a node can be defined as the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.\n",
    "- **Height of the Tree:** The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operations Of Tree Data Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create** – create a tree in the data structure.\n",
    "- **Insert** − Inserts data in a tree.\n",
    "- **Delete** - delete data in a tree.\n",
    "- **Search** − Searches specific data in a tree to check whether it is present or not.\n",
    "- **Traversal** - print each node in the tree at least once"
